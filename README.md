This is the work folder for my "unified-html-syntax" pull request for [TiddlyWiki](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5).

The "diffing" folder has a README explaining how to create static versions of the [tw5.com](https://tiddlywiki.com/) wiki, in order to [diff](https://winmerge.org/) them. I did this to see if unexpected things break. I am sure that they dont, at least not in the tw5.com wiki. I did not diff all other wikis so far, that will take a long while. When [Jermolene](https://github.com/Jermolene) gives his OK for this pull request, I will.

The "doc" folder contains the source of the documentation wiki for this pull request. Below link leads to an online version of it. That is based on the "unified-html-syntax" branch, so you can play around with the syntax changes introduced by my pull request. I document these changes in the Tiddler [WikiText to HTML Examples](https://nilslindemann.github.io/TiddlyWiki5-unified-html-syntax--PR-Work-Folder/singlefile.html#WikiText%20to%20HTML%20Examples). You can also run the wiki via Node.js by using the "run server.batch" in the "doc" folder. In that case, make sure you have [my fork of the TiddlyWiki codebase](https://github.com/nilslindemann/TiddlyWiki5) locally available. Do not change the name of the "TiddlyWiki5" folder, and put this work folder aside of it. Alternatively edit the relative links in the batches contained here.
