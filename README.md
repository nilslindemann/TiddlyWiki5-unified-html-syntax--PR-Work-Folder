This is the work folder for my [unified-html-syntax](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/pull/6135) pull request for [TiddlyWiki](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5).

For the batches inside _diffing_ and _doc_ to work, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and [my fork of the TiddlyWiki codebase](https://github.com/nilslindemann/TiddlyWiki5) locally available. Do not change the name of the _TiddlyWiki5_ folder, and put this work folder aside of it. Alternatively, edit the relative links in the batches. For the python script to work, you need [Python](https://www.python.org/), and the [regex](https://pypi.org/project/regex/) module (run `pip install regex` in a console). When you have set this up, you can proceed as follows.

The _run all tiddlywiki tests.bat_ runs the tests contained in the _TiddlyWiki5/editions/test_ wiki in the TiddlyWiki5 Repo.

The _diffing_ folder has a README explaining how to create static versions of the [tw5.com](https://tiddlywiki.com/) wiki, in order to [diff](https://winmerge.org/) them. I did this to see if unexpected things break, and I am sure that they don't, at least not in the tw5.com wiki. I did not diff all other wikis contained in _TiddlyWiki5/editions_. That will take a long while. When [Jermolene](https://github.com/Jermolene) gives his OK for this pull request, I am willing to do that. __Update__: We are currently discussing Jeremy's idea to implement a mime type or a comparable solution for this new syntax, which sounds like a good idea, because it preserves backwards compatibility. You can follow the discussion [here](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/pull/6135).

The _doc_ folder contains the source of a wiki documenting this pull request. [Here](https://nilslindemann.github.io/TiddlyWiki5-unified-html-syntax--PR-Work-Folder/singlefile.html) is an online version. This online version is based on the "unified-html-syntax" branch, so you can play around with my syntax changes. I document these changes in the Tiddler [WikiText to HTML Examples](https://nilslindemann.github.io/TiddlyWiki5-unified-html-syntax--PR-Work-Folder/singlefile.html#WikiText%20to%20HTML%20Examples).

You can also download this wiki [here](https://github.com/nilslindemann/TiddlyWiki5-unified-html-syntax--PR-Work-Folder/blob/master/docs/singlefile.html), or you can run the wiki via Node.js, by using the _run wiki via nodejs.batch_ in the _doc_ folder.
