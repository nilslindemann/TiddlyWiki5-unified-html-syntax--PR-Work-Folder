This is the work folder for my [refined-html-syntax](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/pull/6156) pull request for [TiddlyWiki](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5).

* For the batches inside _diffing_ and _doc_ to work, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and [my fork of the TiddlyWiki codebase](https://github.com/nilslindemann/TiddlyWiki5) locally available. Do not change the name of the _TiddlyWiki5_ folder, and put this work folder aside of it. Alternatively, edit the relative links in the batches.
* For the python script to work, you further need [Python](https://www.python.org/), and the [regex](https://pypi.org/project/regex/) module (run `pip install regex` in a console).

The _run all tiddlywiki tests.bat_ runs the tests contained in the _editions/test_ wiki in my fork of the TiddlyWiki5 Repo.

The _diffing_ folder has a [README](https://github.com/nilslindemann/TiddlyWiki5-unified-html-syntax--PR-Work-Folder/blob/master/diffing/README.md) explaining how to create static versions of the [tw5.com](https://tiddlywiki.com/) wiki, in order to [diff](https://winmerge.org/) them.

The _doc_ folder contains the source of a wiki documenting this pull request. __[Here is an online version](https://nilslindemann.github.io/TiddlyWiki5-unified-html-syntax--PR-Work-Folder/singlefile.html). The Wiki is based on the [refined-html-syntax-DIFF branch](https://github.com/nilslindemann/TiddlyWiki5/tree/refined-html-syntax-diff)__, so you can play around with my syntax changes. I document these changes in the Tiddler [WikiText to HTML Examples](https://nilslindemann.github.io/TiddlyWiki5-unified-html-syntax--PR-Work-Folder/singlefile.html#WikiText%20to%20HTML%20Examples). You can also [download the online version](https://github.com/nilslindemann/TiddlyWiki5-unified-html-syntax--PR-Work-Folder/blob/master/docs/singlefile.html), or you can run the wiki via Node.js, by using the _run wiki via nodejs.batch_ in the _doc_ folder.
